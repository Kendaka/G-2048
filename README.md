# 2048
This is a fun take on the classic 2048 game, built with React and Express! Slide and merge tiles on a 4x4 grid to try and reach the elusive 2048 tile. The game features a React-based interface with smooth animations, while an Express backend keeps track of high scores. Itâ€™s a great project to explore both game mechanics and backend integration.
